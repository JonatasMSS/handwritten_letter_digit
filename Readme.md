## ðŸ§  Handwritten Letter Recognition with Deep Learning 

This project uses Deep Learning for handwritten letter recognition. The model is based on Keras/TensorFlow, and the project includes training data, a Jupyter notebook (likely for experimentation and training), and the model saved in different formats.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (IPython)
- Keras/TensorFlow
- Deep Learning

## ðŸ“‚ Project Architecture

### ðŸ“„ Main Files

- `Deep_learning_letras.ipynb` ðŸ§ : Jupyter notebook containing the code for training, evaluation, and visualization of the Deep Learning model.
- `handwritten_letters.csv` ðŸ“Š: CSV file containing the training data for handwritten letter recognition.
- `letters_model.h5` ðŸ’¾ & `letters_model.keras` ðŸ’¾: Trained model saved in different formats (H5 and Keras). The redundancy may indicate different development stages or loading options.
- `archive.zip` ðŸ“¦: Compressed file containing the images to be used.
